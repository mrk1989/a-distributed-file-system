Distributed File System (DFS)s are virtual file systems which span over multiple networked computers, thus providing distributed storage. With DFS, system administrators can make it easy for users to access and manage files that are physically distributed across a network.

A file system, in turn is a subsystem of an operating system whose purpose is to provide long term storage.  With DFS, files can be distributed across multiple nodes in a network appear to users as if they reside in one place on the network. Users no longer need to know and specify the actual physical location of files in order to access them.
